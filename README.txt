Hello! Welcome to project "heart_disease".
You can check this dataset in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/heart-disease-dataset




About Dataset
This heart disease dataset is curated by combining 5 popular heart disease datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:

Cleveland
Hungarian
Switzerland
Long Beach VA
Statlog (Heart) Data Set.
This dataset consists of 1190 instances with 11 features. These datasets were collected and combined at one place to help advance research on CAD-related machine learning and data mining algorithms, and hopefully to ultimately advance clinical diagnosis and early treatment.

I've done machine learning and deep learning models.



on machine learning I've done a few models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Support Vector
Random Forest
Xgboost
Gradient Boosting
Ada Boosting
K-Nearest Neighbors
and at the end I did AutoLogger. AutoLogger can create all existing ML models at once and train them instead of manually creating models all the time.
At first I showed how I manually created and tested models, but at the end I did everything through AutoLogger to show what I can do.



I created a regular Artificial Neural Network for deep learning, so it is quite enough for this project. 



You can find ML models here: /models/machine_learning/ml_models
find Deep Learning at this path: /models/deep_learnig/neural_network

I did everything in jupyter notebook.
